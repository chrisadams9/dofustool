This is a tool I am developing for Dofus players to get instant help with different maps, hunts, skins, and more. I am planning to add more items to the Dofus map. In addition to that, soon there will be more hints on the treasure hunt page.

### Map
There is a map for the main Ankama continent along with 5 divine dimensions. You can choose the map to explore from the top of the page.

### Hunt
On the hunt page, you can find next hints by entering the current position and hint direction. Pretty simple to use.

### Skins
There is a vast collection of skins from all the classes of Dofus. Just click on the skin and you'll see the codes for the skin elements. Copy and paste the code in the game to have the skin for your character.

I will try to update it as regularly as I can. If you are also a player and want to help me in this project, please contact me through the website contact page.
